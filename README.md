**FSharpx** is a library for the .NET platform implementing general functional constructs on top of the F# core library. 
Its main target is F# but it aims to be compatible with all .NET languages wherever possible.

It currently implements:

 * Several standard monads: State, Reader, Writer, Either, Continuation, Distribution
 * Iteratee
 * Validation applicative functor
 * General functions like flip
 * Additional functions around collections
 * Functions to make C# - F# interop easier.
